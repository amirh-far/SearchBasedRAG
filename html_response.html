<p>KServe (also known as KServe) is an open-source project under the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation that provides a standardized way to serve machine learning models. The main usages of KServe are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Model Serving</strong>: KServe allows you to deploy and manage machine learning models in a scalable and secure manner.</li>
<li><strong>Inference</strong>: KServe provides a data plane API for inference, which enables you to send requests to your deployed models and receive predictions.</li>
<li><strong>Model Management</strong>: KServe supports multiple model formats and frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and more, making it easy to manage and deploy different types of models.</li>
<li><strong>Customization</strong>: KServe allows you to customize pre-processing, prediction, and post-processing handlers for your models, giving you flexibility in how you want to serve your models.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Other Tools</strong>: KServe is designed to work seamlessly with other tools and frameworks in the machine learning ecosystem, such as ModelMesh, making it easy to integrate into your existing workflows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the key features of KServe include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>InferenceGraph</strong>: a new feature that allows you to define complex inference workflows</li>
<li><strong>InferenceService API</strong>: a standardized API for deploying models on KServe and other platforms</li>
<li><strong>Python Runtime API</strong>: a Python API that implements a standardized model server API following open inference protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the main usage of KServe is to make it easy to serve machine learning models in a scalable, secure, and customizable way, allowing you to focus on building and deploying your models rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure.</p>
